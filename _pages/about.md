I'm a first year PhD student at the Weizmann Institute of Science, where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Prof. David Peleg](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/math/peleg/).I did my Msc under David as well and before that I got a Bachlor degree in computer science from Bar-Ilan university. I'm mainly interested in fault tolerant distributed computing trying to give fresh takes on classical problems e.g consensus and state maching replication, and come up with interesting new models.

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured Markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various Markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
